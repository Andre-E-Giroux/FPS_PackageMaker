-(DONE) Allow interuptable reloading/break them up (Shotgun) have a window to stop it. 
-(DONE) *Bonus* Clean Fire1 from WeaponHitscan script to move most to the WeaponBaseScript, allowing for easier integration for the projectile weapon.
-(DONE_VERIFY AGAIN!) Bloom affect when firing weapon
-(Universal Crosshair added, unique: NO) Show the cone with a crosshair (Scaling a decal won't work, unique crosshair for each weapon (Yay new VAR!))
-(Done)Weapon switch speed implementd, with animation
-(Done) Decal spawn on terrain hit from weapon

-(Done)Projectile Weapons
-(Done)UI Copyright
-(Done)Projectile Weapons explosion variant
-(Updated) Clean up and catagorise weapon inspectors(ON HOLD, WENT DOWN A RABBIT HOLE AND IT IS DEEP!)
-(Done) Added a pre-determined shot direction for weapons. When "areShotPreDetermined" is set to true, random accuracy is bypassed, the inspector will show an array of Vector3s, each vector 3 is a single shot
				NOTES: MAY NEED TO ADD A NEW FUNCTION TO BASE WEAPON, WHERE SHOTS DEVIATE IN A CONTROLLED MANER. PRE SET SPREAD. ADDING THIS WOULD ADD THE ABILITY TO 
				MAKE MELLE USE HITSCAN TO ATTACK AND ADD AN EXTRA OPTION TO WEAPON
-(Done)Melee weapon "hitscan"
-(Done)Show Weapons hud, similar to Dishonored. (Press weapon switch button, show line of weapons)
	Added the singleHitDamage bool, which allows the the use of the multiple weapon spread only doing one set of damage per group of raycasts
	Example, one click spawns 3 rays, two hits 1 person and the last hits another. Both target hit will receive the same damage, because the raycasts 
	that hit the same target as another will be ignored	
- (Done- Revise later)Increase better connections to accuracy settings and cross hair (Updated by 2x the accuracy deviation in Base Weapon class)
