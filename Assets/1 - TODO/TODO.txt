-(DONE) Allow interuptable reloading/break them up (Shotgun) have a window to stop it. 
-(DONE) *Bonus* Clean Fire1 from WeaponHitscan script to move most to the WeaponBaseScript, allowing for easier integration for the projectile weapon.
-(DONE_VERIFY AGAIN!) Bloom affect when firing weapon
-(Universal Crosshair added, unique: NO) Show the cone with a crosshair (Scaling a decal won't work, unique crosshair for each weapon (Yay new VAR!))
-(Done)Weapon switch speed implementd, with animation
-(Done) Decal spawn on terrain hit from weapon
-(Done, play with it to modify until satisfy)Modify cone accuracy based on movement and stance
-(Done)Projectile Weapons
-(Done)UI Copyright
-(Done)Projectile Weapons explosion variant
-(Updated) Clean up and catagorise weapon inspectors(ON HOLD, WENT DOWN A RABBIT HOLE AND IT IS DEEP!)



CRITCAL BUGS:
 -New weapon inspector does not keep the changes from editor mode to run mode. The changes need to be done in the prefab itself, rather than the object in the scene.
 -New weapon inspector needs a more fleshed out layer mask for the entity and hittable objects, as it attack even the player itself (SUICIDE!)


-(CURRENTLY WORKING ON)Melee weapon
	NOTES: MAY NEED TO ADD A NEW FUNCTION TO BASE WEAPON, WHERE SHOTS DEVIATE IN A CONTROLLED MANOR. PRE SET SPREAD. ADDING THIS WOULD ADD THE ABILITY TO 
	MAKE MELLE USE HITSCAN TO ATTACK AND ADD AN EXTRA OPTION TO WEAPON
-Show Weapons hud, similar to Dishonored. (Press weapon switch button, show line of weapons)
-Fine tune movement
-Enemy ragdoll
-Gun push force on RG objects

-(CONTINUOS)Update Comments on scripts



BUGS: 
-when smashing the camera down, camera may inverse due to the clamp
-Camera jitters when turning horziontal and player is straffing
-RANDOMLY when gun is fired, then reloaded in a certain way or as soon as the game loads (not sure) the gun will continuosly fire, but still follow its firing pattern:
	will still shoot as set by fire speed, burst, reload and ammo constraints. The firing cannot be stopped unless ammo is limited and depleted.
-(Possible bug) If projectile is to fast, it will phase through objects, "missing" the target, or phasing through object and hitting a target that should safe
		add a function where a raycast is sent out from the projectiles location last frame to the current position.
		The raycast will detect if there is an object between them and cuase the effects on hit to happen on that object and point of hit detected by raycast.



BUG FIXES (list started 15/07/2022):
-Fixed a bug where burst weapons fire automatically after the player shoots while 
  weapon is empty, then reloads the weapon.
